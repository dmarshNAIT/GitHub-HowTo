# GitHub-HowTo
We will be using GitHub for all the coding assessments in this course. This includes 3 steps:
+ accepting the assignment
+ downloading the starter files to your computer
+ uploading your completed assignment.

Let's look at each of those 3 parts.

# Accepting the assignment
![1-Accepting](https://github.com/dmarshNAIT/GitHub-HowTo/assets/55507008/459b27b3-82a0-4552-99a9-993ea78cbea3)
1. Find your assignment on Moodle, and click on the link that starts with classroom.google.com.
2. The first time you accept an assignment for each course, you'll be invited to select your name from the class list. This connects your GitHub account with your actual human name.
3. Click the big green **Accept** button. This will create a repository for you: a private folder that contains all the starter files for your assignment.
4. Click **Refresh** and you'll see a link to your repo in blue text.

# Downloading the starter files
There are a few different ways to do this. You do not need to do **all** of them, but if you have issues with one, there are workarounds!

## Using GitHub Desktop (recommended)
In order to use this approach, you will need to download Git (which is a system for tracking changes to computer files) as well as GitHub Desktop (an application that makes the Git process a little easier).
+ Download Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads
+ Download GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/

1. First, open up your repo in a regular internet browser. If you lost the link, you can always click the classroom.google.com link from the previous step, and it'll show you the same blue repo link again.
2. Click the big green button that says **Code** then select **Open with GitHub Desktop**.
3. This launches GitHub Desktop. You can choose where on your computer you'd like to save the contents of this repo. Click **Clone**, which makes a copy of the repo's contents in that location on your computer.
4. Now, you can open it up in your file explorer and view and edit all those files!

## Using the browser

## Using the command line

# Uploading your completed assignment
Once you've made changes, it's time to get those changes on GitHub so your instructor can review them.

## Using GitHub Desktop (recommended)

1. After you've saved your changes, open up GitHub Desktop.
2. You should see a little summary of all your changes. Add in a brief description of what you've done (e.g. "submitted final version", "fixed validation bug", etc) then click the blue **Commit** button. This saves a new version of your entire repo. Then, click **Push**: this uploads that latest version to GitHub, and you're done!
3. To make sure it did upload properly, you can always open it in your browser and view your changes there.
